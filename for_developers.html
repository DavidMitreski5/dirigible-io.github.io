					<p class="lead">Eclipse Dirigible provides the full end-to-end coverage of the development process from 
					definition throughout development, testing, operations and monitoring. Its nature of being all-in-one instance,
					gives it the completeness in the sense that the tooling as well as the runtime services are in one and the same place.
					There is a clear path on how you model and develop your service, how to publish it, how to test it and afterwards how you can 
					discover it, configure it as well as monitor it. The outlook is to add even additional features in the area of project management,
					collaboration and API management.
