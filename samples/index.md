===

This section collects various applications created to demonstrate the main use purposes and strengths of the cloud toolkit.
They are built on scenarios with different complexity level, from exemplary samples targeting demonstration of single features to complete end-to-end solutions.

Exemplary Samples
---

* [Data Model](data_model.html) - provides detailed description of the supported data structure descriptors and the corresponding database artifacts.
* [Entity Service](entity_service.html) - creates a domain model object and generates a RESTful service on top.
* [Entity User Interface](entity_ui.html) - generates pattern-based user interface on top of an [entity service](entity_service.html).
