Dirigible Samples Space
===

Dirigible Samples collect various applications created to demonstrate the main usages and strengths of the toolkit.
They are built on scenarios with different complexity level from simple samples targeting demoing a single feature to a complete end-to-end solutions

Simple Samples
---

* [Data Model](data_model.html) - detailed description of the supported data structure descriptors and the corresponding database artifacts
* [Entity Service](entity_service.html) - create a domain model object and generate RESTful service on top
* [Entity User Interface](entity_ui.html) - generate pattern-based user interface on top of na [entity service](entity_service.html)
* JavaScript Service & Library - implement your own custom algorithms using the most popular dynamic language - JavaScript. Along with the fairly good number of out-of-the-box utilities implied in the context to speed-up the developer productivity, it is also shown how you can create your own set of functions and pack them as a libraries for later reuse

* [Simple Routing](simple_routing.html) - more advanced topics follows concerning integration of your application with external services. The first one shows the most simple integration service you can ever have - restful service with simple state based implementation
* [Shielding JavaScript Service](shielding_js.html) - the second one shows how to model your own web service and expose it, by connecting it to a JavaScript service as implementation.
* [Scheduling Job on JavaScript Service](scheduled_job.html) - next sample shows how to schedule a job which triggers the execution of a JavaScript Service.
