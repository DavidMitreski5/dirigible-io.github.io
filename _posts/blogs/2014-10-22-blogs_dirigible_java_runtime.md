In attempt to attract the 9 million happy Java developers to the Dirigible community, we have
introduced Java as runtime language. Yes, finally we can run our Java code in the cloud the way
we like it, with Dirigible.

To explore the new "<strong><em>Java Services</em></strong>" features, we’ll create a simple "gamification" project. It will contain only one service and a couple of helper classes. We’ll take advantage of Java by using 
some of the most popular classes and capabilities in the language, such as <em>Collections</em><em>Comparable</em>,
and of course <em>Generics</em>. The service will be responsible for calculating and distributing the results
of the gamification. We’ll deliver the scores in two manners – displaying them to the user, or
sending them via e-mail.
