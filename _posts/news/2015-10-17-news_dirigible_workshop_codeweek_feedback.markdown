###Dirigible Workshop CodeWeek - Feedback

<sub class="post-info">October 17, 2015</sub>

Great event! We are looking forward for the next one...

There were various group of participants - students, teachers, evangelists, junior and senior experts from commercial companies and geeks.

First we gave an overview about the project - history, building blocks, concepts and architecture. Then step by step the participants have created their first Dirigible project.

We gathered tons of feedback about the future capabilities, which can be useful for cloud developers. 
It is collected in the forum's topic:
[https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1071310/](https://www.eclipse.org/forums/index.php/t/1071310/)

The mailing list dirigible-dev @ eclipse.org is always open to receive new ideas as well.
