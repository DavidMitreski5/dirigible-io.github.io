Over the weekend, the seventh edition of <a href="http://hackfmi.com/" target="_blank">HackFMI</a> - **Hack for Start!** took place.

There were plenty of interesting ideas, code and lots of fun!

We are proud that the team **Brainstormers** - Marina, Stoyan, Antonio, Emil, Ignat and Georgi were among the <a href="http://hackfmi.com/hackfmi7-the-winners/" target="_blank">winners</a>!

The team developed a mobile application that helps all people with disabilities to move more easily in the urban environment. The mobile application provides a map with the most convenient route from point A to point B, which is set to meet the needs of such consumers. The backend REST services were implemented using Eclipse Dirigible platform.
