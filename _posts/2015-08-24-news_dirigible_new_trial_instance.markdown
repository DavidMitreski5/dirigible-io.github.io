		<b><h3>New Trial Instance at Eclipse.org</h3></b>
		<div class="post-info">August 24, 2015</div>
		
		<p>
		Trial instance of Dirigible has been moved to Eclipse.org - <a href="http://dirigible.eclipse.org">http://dirigible.eclipse.org</a>.
		The old link <a href="http://trial.dirigible.io">http://trial.dirigible.io</a> redirects to the same new location.
		</p>
		The first screen asks for selection of a nickname for instant anonymous access to Dirigible. This is required for the further workspace creation.

		After accessing, the users have full access to all capabilities in a shared mode, hence do not be constructive in destruction, which will not be counted at this instance.
		Instead of this you can try the new feature - injected API code-completion in Orion editor:

		Enjoy!
