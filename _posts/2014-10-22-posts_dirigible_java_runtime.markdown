		In attempt to attract the 9 million happy Java developers to the Dirigible community, we have</br>
		introduced Java as runtime language. Yes, finally we can run our Java code in the cloud the way<br>
		we like it, with Dirigible.</br>
		To explore the new "<strong><em>Java Services</em></strong>" features, we’ll create a simple "gamification" project. It will</br>
		contain only one service and a couple of helper classes. We’ll take advantage of Java by using</br>
		some of the most popular classes and capabilities in the language, such as <em>Collections</em><em>Comparable</em>,</br>
		and of course <em>Generics</em>. The service will be responsible for calculating and distributing the results</br>
		of the gamification. We’ll deliver the scores in two manners – displaying them to the user, or</br>
		sending them via e-mail.
