###Dirigible enables dynamic in-memory Java runtime

<sub class="post-info">October 22, 2014 by Yordan	Pavlov</sub>

In attempt to attract the 9 million happy Java developers to the Dirigible community, we have</br>
introduced Java as runtime language. Yes, finally we can run our Java code in the cloud the way<br>
we like it, with Dirigible.</br>
To explore the new "<strong><em>Java Services</em></strong>" features, we’ll create a simple "gamification" project. It will</br>
contain only one service and a couple of helper classes. We’ll take advantage of Java by using</br>
some of the most popular classes and capabilities in the language, such as <em>Collections</em><em>Comparable</em>,</br>
and of course <em>Generics</em>. The service will be responsible for calculating and distributing the results</br>
of the gamification. We’ll deliver the scores in two manners – displaying them to the user, or</br>
sending them via e-mail.
