Backup - Project Import and Export
===

One or multiple projects can be exported and imported as a ZIP archive. This is the simplest and fastest way to transfer project content to Eclipse Dirigible. You can do this through both the main menu and the context menu.

> You can use this functionality also in the case of mass import of project artifacts, such as images in the Web content.

This feature can be also used for importing sample projects from public sources and for sharing projects between accounts. However, for real team-source management, it is recommended to use [Git](git.html)).

Backup Data
---

Except creating a backup of the project, it is good practice to have a backup of the content. You can export tables data into **\*.dsv** files.
