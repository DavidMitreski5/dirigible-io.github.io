Data Structures
===

Overview
---


In the context of a cloud toolkit, the term *Data Structures* refers to the domain model of an application. The actual entities in a domain model directly correspond to the underlying database entities, that is, tables and views. There is no additional abstract layer between the code of your application and the actual model in the target storage.

Tables
---

*Table Model* is a JSON formatted **\*.table** descriptor. It represents the layout of the database table, which will be created during the activation process.

Example descriptor:

```javascript

	{
	  "tableName":"TEST001",
	  "columns":
	    [
	      {
	        "name":"ID",
	        "type":"INTEGER",
	        "length":"0",
	        "notNull":"true",
	        "primaryKey":"true",
	        "defaultValue":""
	      }
	      ,
	      {
	        "name":"NAME",
	        "type":"VARCHAR",
	        "length":"20",
	        "notNull":"false",
	        "primaryKey":"false",
	        "defaultValue":""
	      }
	      ,
	      {
	        "name":"DATEOFBIRTH",
	        "type":"DATE",
	        "length":"0",
	        "notNull":"false",
	        "primaryKey":"false",
	        "defaultValue":""
	      }
	      ,
	      {
	        "name":"SALARY",
	        "type":"DOUBLE",
	        "length":"0",
	        "notNull":"false",
	        "primaryKey":"false",
	        "defaultValue":""
	      }
	    ]
	}
```

The supported database types are:

*	*VARCHAR*     - for text-based fields long up to 2K characters
*	*CHAR*        - for text-based fields with fixed length of up to 255 characters
*	*INTEGER*     - 32 bit
*	*BIGINT*      - 64 bit
*	*SMALLINT*    - 16 bit
*	*REAL*        - 7 digits of mantissa
*	*DOUBLE*      - 15 digits of mantissa
*	*DATE*        - represents a date consisting of day, month, and year
*	*TIME*        - represents a time consisting of hours, minutes, and seconds
*	*TIMESTAMP*   - represents DATE,  TIME, a nanosecond field, and a time zone
*	*BLOB*        - a binary object, such as an image, audio, etc.

The activation of the table descriptor is the process of creating a database table in the target database. The activator constructs a "CREATE TABLE" SQL statement considering the dialect of the target database system. If a particular table name already exists, the activator checks whether there is a compatible change, such as adding new columns, and constructs an "ALTER TABLE" SQL statement. If the change is incompatible, the activator returns an error that has to be solved manually through the SQL Console.

Views
---

*View Model* is a JSON formatted **\*.view** descriptor of a database view. It is usually a combination of multiple tables and is used for reporting purposes. The script should follow the SQL92 standard or has to be aligned with the dialect of the target database.

Data Files
---

Delimiter Separated Values (**\*.dsv**) data files are used for importing test data during development or for defining static content for some nomenclatures. The data file name has to be the same as the target table name. The delimiter uses the \`|\` char, and the order of the data fields should be the same as the natural order in the target table. If you want to import particular data only once, this can be done via the *Import Data* wizard.

Be careful when using static data in tables. [Entity Services](entity_service.html) (generated by the templates) use sequence algorithm to identity columns starting from **1**.

The automatic re-initialization of static content from the data file can be achieved when you create a **\*.dsv** file under the *DataStructures* folder of the given project.
