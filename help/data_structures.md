Data Structures
===

###Overview###

The *Data Structures* term, in the context of the cloud toolkit, is used for referring the Domain Model of an application. For pragmatic reasons, it is chosen the actual entities in a domain model to correspond 1:1 to the underlying database entities - tables and views. There is no additional abstract layer between your application code and the actual model in the target storage.

###Tables###

*Table Model* is a JSON formatted **\*.table** descriptor which represents the layout of the database table which will be created during the activation process.

Example descriptor:
<pre><code>
{
  "tableName":"TEST001",
  "columns":
    [
      {
        "name":"ID",
        "type":"INTEGER",
        "length":"0",
        "notNull":"true",
        "primaryKey":"true",
        "defaultValue":""
      }
      ,
      {
        "name":"NAME",
        "type":"VARCHAR",
        "length":"20",
        "notNull":"false",
        "primaryKey":"false",
        "defaultValue":""
      }
      ,
      {
        "name":"DATEOFBIRTH",
        "type":"DATE",
        "length":"0",
        "notNull":"false",
        "primaryKey":"false",
        "defaultValue":""
      }
      ,
      {
        "name":"SALARY",
        "type":"DOUBLE",
        "length":"0",
        "notNull":"false",
        "primaryKey":"false",
        "defaultValue":""
      }
    ]
}
</code></pre>

The supported database types are:

*	*VARCHAR*     - for text-based fields up to 2K characters
*	*CHAR*        - for text-based fields with fixed length up to 255 characters
*	*INTEGER*     - 32 bit
*	*BIGINT*      - 64 bit
*	*SMALLINT*    - 16 bit
*	*REAL*        - 7 digits of mantissa
*	*DOUBLE*      - 15 digits of mantissa
*	*DATE*        - represents a date consisting of day, month, and year
*	*TIME*        - represents a time consisting of hours, minutes, and seconds
*	*TIMESTAMP*   - represents DATE, plus TIME, plus a nanosecond field, and time zone
*	*BLOB*        - binary object - images, audio, etc.

Activation of table descriptor is a process of creating a database table in the target database. The activator constructs a "CREATE TABLE" SQL statement considering the dialect of the target database system. If a particular table name already exists, the activator checks whether there is a compatible change (new columns added) and construct an "ALTER TABLE" SQL statement. If the change is incompatible, the activator returns an error, which has to be solved manually via the SQL Console.

###Views###

*View Model* is a JSON formatted **\*.view** descriptor of a database view. Mostly it is a joint between multiple tables used for reporting purposes. The script should follow the SQL92 standard, or has to be aligned with the dialect of the target database.

###Data Files###

Delimiter Separated Values (**\*.dsv**) data files are used for importing test data during development, or for defining static content for some nomenclatures, for example. The convention is: the data file name should be the same as the target table name. The delimiter uses the "|" char and the order of the data fields should be the same as the natural order in the target table. If you want to import some data only once, this can be done via the *Import Data* wizard.

Be careful when using static data in tables. [Entity Services](entity_service.html) (generated by the templates) use sequence algorithm for identity column starting from **1**.

The automatic re-initialization of static content from the data file can be achieved when you create a **\*.dsv** file under the *DataStructures* folder of the given project.
