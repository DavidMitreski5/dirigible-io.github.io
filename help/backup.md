Backup - Project Import and Export
===

It is possible for you to export and import content of a given project or multiple projects as a ZIP archive. This is the simplest and fastest way to transfer project content to Dirigible. The actions are available through both the main and the context menu.

###Import###

> You can use this functionality also in the case of mass import of project artifacts - for example, images in the Web content.

This feature can be also used for importing sample projects from public sources, or for sharing projects between accounts (although for real team-source management, the recommended approach is via [Git](git.html)).

###Backup Data###

Except creating backup of the project, it is good practice to have backup of the content. This can be easily done by exporting tables data into **\*.dsv** files.
