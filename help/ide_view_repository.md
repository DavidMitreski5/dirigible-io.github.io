{{ page.title }} View
===

The Repository view gives access to the raw structure of the underlying *Repository* content.
There you can inspect at low level the project and folder structure, as well as the artifacts content, in the read-only plain editor.
The view enables the user to create new collections and resources, to delete existing ones, or to export them.
