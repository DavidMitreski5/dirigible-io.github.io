Tooling
===

One of the biggest advantages of Dirigible project is its powerful design-time tooling. It claims to be Development Environment as a Service (DEaaS), means it is complete enough to cope with all the needs of a developer, building cloud based dynamic application only via a web browser.
It is too ambitious statement and it realy is because it is based on the greatest yet mass-used so far IDE by the on-premise developers - [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) and its very innovative project [RAP](http://eclipse.org/rap/).

The different views and editors are separated by default to a few perspective depending on the purpose:

* [Workspace Perspective](workspace_perspective.html) - responsible to overall project management.

* [Database Perspective](database_perspective.html) - for inspecting low level raw content directly in the underlying database with the Database Browser and SQL Console

![DB Table Definition](../samples/bookstore/15_books_db_table_def.png)

* [Repository Perspective](repository_perspective.html) - looking into the current state as well as the history of the repository content

* [Registry Perspective](registry.html) - an integrated view to the published resources and active service end-points in the runtime containers
