Tooling
===

One of the biggest advantages of Dirigible project is its powerful design-time tooling. It claims to be Development Environment as a Service (DEaaS), meaning it is complete enough to cope with all needs of a developer, building a cloud-based dynamic application only via a Web browser.
This sounds like a too ambitious statement and it really is, because it is based on the greatest yet mass used so far IDE by on-premise developers - [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) and its very innovative project [RAP](http://eclipse.org/rap/).

By default, the different views and editors are separated to a few perspectives depending on the purpose:

* [Workspace Perspective](workspace_perspective.html) - used for overall project management.

* [Database Perspective](database_perspective.html) - preferable for inspecting low-level raw content directly in the underlying database with the Database Browser and SQL Console.

![DB Table Definition](../samples/bookstore/15_books_db_table_def.png)

* [Repository Perspective](repository_perspective.html) - looks into the current state and the history of the repository content.

* [Registry Perspective](registry.html) - an integrated view to the published resources and active service endpoints in the runtime containers.
