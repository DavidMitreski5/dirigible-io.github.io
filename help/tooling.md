Tooling
===

One of the biggest advantages of the Eclipse Dirigible project is its powerful design-time tooling. It claims to be Integrated Development Environment as a Service (IDEaaS). This means that the platform is complete enough to be able to cope with all developer needs. It enables the developers to build a cloud-based dynamic application only via a Web browser.

This sounds like a too ambitious statement, but Eclipse Dirigible meets this criteria as it is based on the greatest mass used IDE by on-premise developers - [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) and its very innovative project - [RAP](http://eclipse.org/rap/).

By default, the different views and editors are separated into a few perspectives:

* [Workspace Perspective](workspace_perspective.html) - used for overall project management.

* [Database Perspective](database_perspective.html) - preferred for inspecting low-level raw content directly in the underlying database with the Database Browser and the SQL Console.

![DB Table Definition](../samples/bookstore/15_books_db_table_def.png)

* [Repository Perspective](repository_perspective.html) - looks into the current state and the history of the repository content.

* [Registry Perspective](registry.html) - an integrated view to the published resources and the active service endpoints in the runtime containers.
