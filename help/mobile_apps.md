Mobile Applications
===

### Overview

Mobile Application support in Dirigible is via [Tabris.js](http://tabrisjs.com). It is a mobile framework that allows you to develop native iOS and Android mobile applications, written entirely in JavaScript. This framework is the right choice when native performance, native look and feel and single code-base (JavaScript) is wanted. Last but not least, it is possible to use existing JavaScript libraries and native extensions to extend the core functionality, when needed.

Unlike other frameworks that use webviews or cross-platform intermediate runtimes, Tabris.js executes the JavaScript directly on the device and renders everything using native widgets. Thanks to the framework capabilities, the developers now can focus more on the mobile application development and less on the platform specifics (iOS and Android).
