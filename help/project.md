Project
===

Dirigible is an open source project that provides Integrated Development Environment as a Service (IDEaaS) as well as the runtime containers integration for the running applications. The applications created with Dirigible comply with the [Dynamic Applications](dynamic_applications.html) concepts and structure.

The main goal of the project is to provide all the required capabilities needed to develop and run an end-to-end, and yet meaningful, vertical scenario in the cloud for shortest time ever. 

The environment itself runs directly in the browser, therefore does not require additional downloads and installations. It packs all the needed containers, which makes it self-contained and well integrated software bundle that can be deployed on any Java based Web Server such as Tomcat, Jetty, JBoss, etc.

The Dirigible project came out of an internal [SAP](http://www.sap.com] initiative to address the extension and adaptation use-cases around SOA and Enterprise Services. On one hand in this project were implied the lessons learned from the standard tools and approaches so far and on the other hand, there were added features aligned with the most recent technologies and architectural patterns related to [Web 2.0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0] and [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5], which made it complete enough to be used as the only tool and environment needed for building and running on demand application in the cloud.


From the beginnig the project follows the principles of Simplicity, Openness, Agility, Completeness and Perfection which provides a sustainable environment where with minimal effort is achieved maximum impact.

[Features](features.html) section describes in detial what is included in the project. [Concepts](concepts.html) section gives you an overview about the internal and the chosen patterns. [Samples](samples.html) shows you how to start and build your first dynamic application in seconds.
