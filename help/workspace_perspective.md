Workspace Perspective
===

This is the place where you actually develop your dynamic Web applications. This perspective contains all views and editors that help you in overall implementation from domain models via services to the user interface.

Yhe main views opened by default in this perspective are:

*	*Workspace Explorer* - it is a standard view on the projects in your [workspace](workspace.html). 
It shows the folder structure and the contained resources. There is a context menu assigned to the project node:

![New Project Menu](../samples/bookstore/2_books_new_project_menu.png)

Through this context menu, you can create new artifacts:

*	[Project](dynamic_applications.html)
*	[Data Structure](data_structures.html)
*	[Scripting Service](scripting_services.html)
*	[User Interface](web_content.html)
*	[Wiki Page](wiki_content.html)
*	[Integration Service](integration_services.html)
*	[Test Case](test_cases.html)

or just regular ones:

*	File 
*	Folder

While selecting an artifact, you can use the *Open* or *Open With* actions to load its content in the corresponding editor, for example, [Source Editor](source_editor.html).
