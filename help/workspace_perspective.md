Workspace Perspective
===

This is the place where you actually develop your dynamic applications. This perspective contains all the views and editors that help you in overall implementation from domain models via services to the user interface.

Main views which are openned by default in this perspective are:

* *Workspace Explorer* - it is a standard view on the projects in your [workspace|workspace.wiki]. It shows the folder structure as well as the contained resources. There is a pop-up menu assigned to the project node:

!../samples/bookstore/2_books_new_project_menu.png!

via which you can create new artifacts:

* [Project|dynamic_applications.wiki]
* [Data Structure|data_structures.wiki]
* [Scripting Service|scripting_services.wiki]
* [User Interface|web_content.wiki]
* [Wiki Page|wiki_content.wiki]
* [Integration Service|integration_services.wiki]
* [Test Case|test_cases.wiki]

or just regular

* File and
* Folder

While selecting an artifact you can use Open or Open With actions to load its content in the corresponding editor e.g. [Source Editor|source_editor.wiki].
