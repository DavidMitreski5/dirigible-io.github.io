The **Workspace** is the developer's place where he/she creates and manages the application artifacts. The first-level citizens of the *workspace* are the *projects*. Each project can contain multiple folders and files (artifacts).

The Workspace explorer displays a standard view on the projects in your workspace. It shows the folder structure along with the files. The artifacts i.e. the project management, can be done via the views and editors in the [Workbench Perspective](ide_perspective_workbench.html).

The IDE supports multiple editors registered for different file (MIME) types. More than one editor can be registered for one file type and in this case a “Open with…” context menu entry is rendered for the user to select, which one to use.

A single user can have multiple workspaces, containing different set of projects.
