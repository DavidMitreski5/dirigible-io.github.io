Repository Perspective
===

The **Repository** perspective gives the access to the raw structure of the underlying *Repository* content.
There you can inspect at low level the project and folder structure, and the artifacts content in the read-only plain editor.

The *Resource History* view lists the most recent versions of the main artifact. It plays a role of local file history. 
As soon as the *Repository* component does not target the version control system by itself, you should rely on the [Git](git.html) 
integration for secure resource management. 

The history of the *Repository* is automatically cleared up after a certain period of time.
