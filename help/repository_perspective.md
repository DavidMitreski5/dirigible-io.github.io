Repository Perspective
===

Repository Perspective gives the access to the raw structure of the underlying Repository content.
There one could inspect at low level the project and folder structure as well as the artifacts content in the read-only plain editor.

Resource History View lists the most recent versions of the main artifact. It plays a role as local file history. 
As soon as the Repository component doesn't target the version control system by itself, you should rely on the [Git](git.html) 
integration for secure resource management. The history of the Repository is automatically cleared up after a given period of time.
