Source Editor
===

Technically, the *Source Editor* provided by the cloud toolkit is embedded version of the familiar 
[ACE Editor](http://ace.c9.io/#nav=about) in a [RAP](https://eclipse.org/rap/) environment. It supports syntax highlighting of the most popular development languages and data formats, such as JavaScript, Ruby, Groovy, JSON, XML, HTML, and more.

**Cut**, **Copy**, **Paste** and **Undo**/**Redo** actions are integrated.

The key bindings are aligned to the standard text editors.
