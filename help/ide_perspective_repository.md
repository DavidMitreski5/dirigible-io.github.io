{{ page.title }} Perspective
===

The **Repository** perspective gives access to the raw structure of the Dirigible instance where the IDE is running. It is comprised of Repository, Snapshot, Preview and Console views.
There the user can inspect at low level the project and folder structure, as well as the artifacts content, in the read-only plain editor.
The user is able to import/export snapshots via the Snapshot view.
