Log Console is a view next to the Log Viewer which shows the real-time log and trace records produced by all the components of a given instance. Underlying implementation is based on WebSockets technology for synchronous bi-directional communication between the client (the Log Console) and the server (Log WebSocket Service).

It is available as a view within the [Workspace Perspective](workspace_perspective.html) in the [Web IDE](tooling.html)

and also as a separate page within the [Registry](registry.html) interface.

If you want to download a full log file for offline reading and analysis, you can do this via the [Log Viewer](log_viewer.html).
