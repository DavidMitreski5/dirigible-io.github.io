*View Model* is a JSON formatted **\*.view** descriptor of a database view. It is usually a combination of multiple tables and is used for reporting purposes. The script should follow the SQL92 standard or has to be aligned with the dialect of the target database.
The synchroniser reads and creates the database views as defined in the model.
